STEPS TO RUNNING CODE:
1. Open a website called "pictoblox.ai". This is where you will import the .sb3 files into.
2. If you get on a web page asking for what would you like to do, selec the Py Editor option. If you don't get this option, it is also fine.
3. Click file, and then "Load from your computer"
4. Upload the file that you want. One will write on the tag, and the other will read the tag.
5. Click run, and enjoy.
   Password for creating a tag is "6580". If you put the wrong password, it will still go though, but it won't unlock the door.
